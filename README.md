Many thanks to @FarhadG with his init bookmarklet and site - the styles are heavily copied that site. (Note: if you are a developer, @FarhadG's tool is very cool!)

You can check out [his repository here.](https://github.com/FarhadG/init)

If there is enough interest, I could also make a chrome extension for this - which would probably be a bit more user friendly.
